He was amiable, pure of heart, and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline. He was an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young age; the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.</p>

After training rigorously in a bid to interact with Pillars as much as she could (since Pillars are strongest people in the Corps), she became the Pillar herself.</p>

She often greets others by saying "yoo-hoo" after suddenly showing up next to them, often startling others. But beneath her smile actually lies a ferocious and hot-headed temperament, and it is revealed that her smile was Shinobu's last respect to carry on Kanae Kocho's personality in order to remember her.</p>

                Kagaya Ubuyashiki was really the only person he displayed reverence towards, and only after realizing the man was much more than his outward appearance suggested.

His expectations for his fellow Demon Slayers are nigh-unrealistic, berating Tengen Uzui for suffering heavy wounds against the Upper Moon and telling him to "fight to the death" when Tengen insists on retiring.</p>

                <p class="white-text">Gyomei embodies the gentle giant archetype, being surprisingly soft-spoken and sensitive, despite his intimidating appearance. He is also shown to be quite pious, carrying his prayer beads at all times and offering prayers in poignant situations. Most notably, Gyomei easily cries over the most insignificant things, accentuating his rather soft nature. This could be due to his love for all living creatures brought about by his religious upbringing, and insinuated when he felt so disgusted by beating up a demon that he would never forget that feeling for the rest of his life.</p>
